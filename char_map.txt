On Input
The following example illustrates all possible combinations of the effects of the
CHAR_MAP option settings on the value retrieved from a database into a character
array.

Assume a database
TABLE strdbase ( ..., strval VARCHAR2(6));

which contains the following strings in the column strval:
"" -- string of length 0
"AB" -- string of length 2
"KING" -- string of length 4
"QUEEN" -- string of length 5
"MILLER" -- string of length 6
In a Pro*C/C++ program, initialize the 5-character host array str with 'X' characters
and use for the retrieval of all the values in column strval:

char str[5] = {'X', 'X', 'X','X', 'X'} ;
short str_ind;  //indicator 값
...
EXEC SQL SELECT strval INTO :str:str_ind FROM strdbase WHERE ... ;
with the following results for the array, str, and the indicator variable, str_ind, as

CHAR_MAP is set to VARCHAR2, CHARF, CHARZ and STRING:

strval    = ""         "AB"      "KING"    "QUEEN"   "MILLER"
---------------------------------------------------------------
VARCHAR2    " " -1     "AB " 0   "KING " 0 "QUEEN" 0 "MILLE" 6
CHARF       "XXXXX" -1 "AB " 0   "KING " 0 "QUEEN" 0 "MILLE" 6
CHARZ       " 0" -1    "AB 0" 0  "KING0" 0 "QUEE0" 5 "MILL0" 6
STRING      "0XXXX" -1 "AB0XX" 0 "KING0" 0 "QUEE0" 5 "MILL0" 6

where 0 stands for the null character, '\0'.

Character Array On output, 
the DBMS and CHAR_MAP options determines the
format that a host variable character array will have in your program. 
When CHAR_MAP=VARCHAR2, 
host variable character arrays are blank padded up to the length
of the array, but never null-terminated.
When DBMS=V7 or V8 (or CHAR_MAP=CHARZ), 
character arrays are blank padded, then null-terminated in the final
position in the array

Consider the following example of character output:
CREATE TABLE test_char (C_col CHAR(10), V_col VARCHAR2(10));
INSERT INTO test_char VALUES ('MILLER', 'KING');
A precompiler program to select from this table contains the following embedded
SQL:
...
char name1[10];
char name2[10];
...
EXEC SQL SELECT C_col, V_col INTO :name1, :name2
Character Data

FROM test_char;
If you precompile the program with CHAR_MAP=VARCHAR2, name1 will contain:
"MILLER####"
that is, the name "MILLER" followed by 4 blanks, with no null-termination. (If name1
had been declared with a size of 15, there are 9 blanks following the name.)
name2 will contain:
"KING######" /* 6 trailing blanks */
If you precompile the program with DBMS=V7 or V8, name1 will contain:
"MILLER###\0" /* 3 trailing blanks, then a null-terminator */
that is, a string containing the name, blank-padded to the length of the column,
followed by a null terminator. name2 will contain:
"KING#####\0"
In summary, if CHAR_MAP=VARCHAR2, the output from either a CHARACTER
column or a VARCHAR2 column is blank-padded to the length of the host variable
array. If DBMS=V7 or V8, the output string is always null-terminated.

The default datatype of utext is the same as the default for any character variables,
CHARZ, which is blank-padded and null-terminated.
Use the CHAR_MAP precompiler option to change the default datatype, as follows:
#include <sqlca.h>
#include <sqlucs2.h>
main()
{
utext employee1[20] ;
/* Change to STRING datatype: */
EXEC ORACLE OPTION (CHAR_MAP=STRING) ;
utext employee2[20] ;
EXEC SQL CREATE TABLE emp (ename CHAR(60)) ;
...
/***********************************************************
Initializing employee1 or employee2 is compiler-dependent.
**********************************************************/
EXEC SQL INSERT INTO emp (ename) VALUES (:employee1) ;
...
EXEC SQL SELECT ename INTO :employee2 FROM emp;
/* employee2 is now not blank-padded and is null-terminated */
